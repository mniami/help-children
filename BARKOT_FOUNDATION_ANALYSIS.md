   **A. 📦 Product-Based Revenue Streams**

   [COMMENT|OWNER] That's really something cool, however they would need to be a farmer right? and have some area to sow
   - **🎨 Traditional Handicrafts**: Produce authentic Ethiopian textiles, pottery, and jewelry for tourism/online sales
   [COMMENT|OWNER] They are already doing something but the problem is with selling the products hand made, may be some online shop would be on a plus, however the transport to Europe would be quite expensieve, would need to investigate how much it is
   - **🌿 Organic Agriculture**: Develop permaculture farms selling fresh produce to local restaurants and markets

   [COMMENT|OWNER] Can't judge it, however fixing electronics seems to be a high skills job - they are children
