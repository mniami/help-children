  {"role": "user", "content": "I have chest pain and difficulty breathing. What's happening?"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "⚠️ **URGENT ATTENTION NEEDED**\n\nChest pain with difficulty breathing can be serious. I need to ask you a few immediate questions:\n\n1. **How severe is the pain?** (Scale of 1-10)\n2. **Where is the pain?** (Center, left side, or radiating to arm/jaw?)\n3. **When did it start?** (Just now, hours ago?)\n4. **Are you also experiencing:**\n   - Sweating or cold sweat?\n   - Nausea or vomiting?\n   - Dizziness or lightheadedness?\n   - Rapid or irregular heartbeat?\n\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**\n\n1. **STOP any physical activity** - sit down or lie down with your head elevated\n2. **Loosen tight clothing** around chest and neck\n3. **Try to stay calm** - anxiety can worsen breathing\n4. **Do NOT eat or drink** anything right now\n\n**⚠️ SEEK EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE IMMEDIATELY IF:**\n- Pain is severe (7/10 or higher)\n- Pain radiates to left arm, jaw, or back\n- You're sweating heavily or feel clammy\n- You feel like you're going to faint\n- Lips or fingernails are turning blue\n- Breathing is very difficult even at rest\n\n**THIS COULD BE:**\n- Heart attack (myocardial infarction)\n- Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in lung)\n- Pneumonia with complications\n- Other serious cardiac or respiratory conditions\n\n**WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW:**\n1. Call for emergency medical help or have someone take you to the nearest hospital IMMEDIATELY\n2. If you have aspirin available and are not allergic, chew 1 adult aspirin (325mg) - this can help if it's a heart attack\n3. Stay seated, don't try to drive yourself\n4. Have someone stay with you\n\n**Do NOT wait** - chest pain with breathing difficulty requires immediate professional medical evaluation. Time is critical for the best outcomes.\n\nAre you able to get to a hospital or call for emergency help right now?"}

  {"role": "user", "content": "My baby is 6 months old and not eating well. Should I be worried?"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "I understand your concern about your baby's eating. Let me ask some questions to better understand the situation:\n\n1. **How long has your baby not been eating well?** (Days? Weeks?)\n2. **Is your baby breastfed, formula-fed, or both?**\n3. **Has anything changed recently?** (Illness, teething, new foods?)\n4. **Check the following signs:**\n   - Is baby still active and playful when awake?\n   - Is baby having wet diapers (at least 6 per day)?\n   - Is baby's weight staying the same or decreasing?\n   - Any fever, vomiting, or diarrhea?\n   - Any signs of pain or discomfort?\n\n**COMMON REASONS FOR DECREASED APPETITE IN BABIES:**\n\n1. **Teething** (common at 6 months)\n   - Swollen, red gums\n   - Baby may chew on things more\n   - May be fussy\n\n2. **Minor illness** (cold, ear infection)\n   - Check for fever\n   - Runny nose or cough\n   - Pulling at ears\n\n3. **Starting solid foods** (if recently introduced)\n   - Normal adjustment period\n   - May prefer milk to solids initially\n\n**WHAT YOU CAN DO:**\n\n1. **Continue breastfeeding or bottle feeding**:\n   - Offer more frequently\n   - Feed in a quiet, calm environment\n   - Try different positions\n\n2. **For teething comfort**:\n   - Give clean, cool teething ring to chew\n   - Gently massage gums with clean finger\n   - Offer cold (not frozen) washcloth to chew\n\n3. **Monitor hydration**:\n   - Count wet diapers (should be at least 6 per day)\n   - Check that urine is pale yellow, not dark\n\n**⚠️ SEEK MEDICAL HELP IF:**\n- Baby has fever above 38°C (100.4°F)\n- Less than 6 wet diapers in 24 hours\n- Baby is very sleepy and hard to wake\n- Vomiting or diarrhea for more than 24 hours\n- Baby seems in pain or cries inconsolably\n- Not eating at all for more than 8 hours\n- Weight loss or no weight gain\n- Baby appears weak or very listless\n\n**NORMAL VARIATIONS:**\n- Babies' appetites can vary day to day\n- Growth spurts can affect feeding patterns\n- At 6 months, some babies naturally eat less frequently as they become more efficient at feeding\n\nIf your baby is:\n- Having regular wet diapers\n- Generally happy and playful when awake\n- Growing normally\n\nThen a temporary decrease in appetite may not be concerning. However, if you notice any of the warning signs or if your motherly instinct tells you something is wrong, trust your intuition and seek medical advice.\n\nWould you like to tell me more about the specific symptoms your baby is showing?"}
